# FL Dataset Description

This dataset presents the relationships between the average nominal speed and the average measured acceleration for six identical printers (Ender 3 Pro) air printing cubes with size 20 × 20 × 3mm. For each print, the layer height is 0.2mm (i.e., each print has 15 layers), and a five-second pause is commanded between each two layers so that the average speed and acceleration can be calculated independently for each layer. For each printer, twelve different print speeds, ranging from 10mm/s to 120mm/s, are set in the commercial slicing software (i.e., each printer prints 12 times at different speeds). However, since the commands in the Gcode files do not exactly satisfy the speed settings in the software, the nominal speed is actually calculated based on the information from the Gcode files. More specifically, it is calculated by dividing the total length of the travel path by the estimated elapsed time shown in the Gcode. As for the measured acceleration, the raw data are measured by ADXL345 accelerometers for both x- and y-axes at sampling frequency being ~200Hz. Then, the accelerations during each layer are extracted, and their RMS values are calculated as the interested data.

The following scatter plot shows the distribution of the datasets for different printers. More detailed data are available in the .csv files. For the .csv files, the first column of the data shows the average nominal speed in different layers, the second column and third column respectively represent the RMS of the measured acceleration for x- and y-axes, while the printer labels and the speed settings are indicated in their file names. The Gcode files are also attached.
