# FL Dataset Description

This repository presents the dataset for a case study of the Federated Learning (FL) applied to additive manufacturing. The dataset is generated by six identical 3D printers (Ender 3 Pro). It is notable that, despite same model, the printers may still have heterogeneous properties due to the location of the printers, tightness of the cables, random effects, etc. Each printer is equipped with a Raspberry pi and two accelerometers (ADXL345) to measure the accelerations of the extruder (X-axis) and the print bed (Y-axis). To generate the dataset, each printer is commanded by Gcode to perform same printing jobs, and the corresponding accelerations are measured. In particular, the measured information of each printer is not shared with each other, and the processing of the data are also computed independently. Given the nature that the raw data is not shared, this dataset is an FL dataset. The setups are as shown in the picture below.

In more detail, this dataset shows the relationships between the average nominal speed and the average measured acceleration for air printing cubes with size 20 × 20 × 3mm. For each print, the layer height is 0.2mm (i.e., each print has 15 layers), and a five-second pause is applied between layers so that the average speed and acceleration can be calculated independently for each layer. For each printer, twelve different print speeds, ranging from 10mm/s to 120mm/s, are set in the commercial slicing software (i.e., each printer prints 12 times at different speeds). However, since the commands in the Gcode files do not exactly satisfy the speed settings in the software, the nominal speed is actually calculated based on the information from the Gcode files. It is calculated by dividing the total length of the travel path by the estimated elapsed time shown in the Gcode. As for the measured acceleration, the raw data are measured at sampling frequency being ~200Hz. Then, the accelerations during each layer are extracted, and their RMS values are calculated as the interested data.

The following scatter plot shows the distribution of the datasets for different printers. More detailed data are available in the .csv files. For the .csv files, the first column of the data shows the average nominal speed in different layers, the second column and third column respectively represent the RMS of the measured accelerations for X- and Y-axes, while the printer labels and the speed settings are indicated in their file names. The Gcode files are also attached.
